#### Learning Goals:
1. Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
1. Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
1. Implement ES6 classes
1. Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
1. Implement a robust testing suite using TDD


#### Wins & Challenges
1. Wins: The game works! 
1. Challenges: Writing tests before writing the implementation code was hard. Also trying to figure out what to test for and how to go about doing that.
